        <h2>1. Description</h2>
        <p>Quick and easy sugar cookies! They are really good, plain or with candies in them. My friend uses chocolate mints on
        top, and they're great!</p>

        <h2>2. Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small bowl, stir together flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set
            aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until smooth. Beat in egg and vanilla. Gradually blend in the dry
            ingredients. Roll rounded teaspoonfuls of dough into balls, and place onto ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
            <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden. Let stand on cookie sheet two minutes before removing to
            cool on wire racks.</li>
        </ol>
